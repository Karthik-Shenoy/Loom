# Loom  
- Loom is a lightweight runtime for building composable multi-agent systems.
- It provides a coroutine-first execution model, structured concurrency, and pluggable coordination policies.
- Agents, tools, and memory are treated as modular components that interact through well-defined runtime contracts, not fixed workflow graphs.
- Loom focuses on reliability, observability, and controlled execution in probabilistic non determistic systems.

## The goal
- provide a minimal kernel for weaving concurrent cognition safely and predictably.
